# Download Winners & Closed Status Features

## Overview
Two new powerful features have been added to the raffle draw system:
1. **Download Winners List** - Export winners to CSV or JSON format
2. **Closed Status** - Lock raffles to prevent any modifications

---

## 1. Download Winners List Feature

### Description
Users can download a complete list of all winners with their prize information in CSV or JSON format. This makes it easy to share results, create reports, or keep records.

### Where to Access
The download feature is available in **two locations**:

#### 1. Raffle Draw Page Header
- Location: Top right corner of raffle detail page
- Button: "Download Winners" with download icon
- Appears when: At least one prize has been drawn
- Downloads: CSV format by default

#### 2. API (Programmatic)
- Endpoint: `GET /api/raffle-draws/:id/winners/download?format=csv|json`
- Supports both CSV and JSON formats

### CSV Format
The downloaded CSV file includes:
- **Position** - Prize position/ranking
- **Prize Name** - Name of the prize
- **Prize Description** - Prize details
- **Prize Value** - Value of the prize
- **Winner Name** - Full name of the winner
- **Winner Email** - Email address
- **Winner Phone** - Phone number
- **Winner Designation** - Job title or designation
- **Ticket Number** - Unique ticket number

### JSON Format
The JSON format includes:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "raffleDraw": {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Summer Giveaway",
      "drawDate": "2024-07-15T18:00:00Z",
      "status": "completed"
    },
    "winners": [
      {
        "position": 1,
        "prizeName": "1st Prize",
        "prizeDescription": "Grand Prize",
        "prizeValue": "500",
        "winnerName": "John Doe",
        "winnerEmail": "john@example.com",
        "winnerPhone": "+1234567890",
        "winnerDesignation": "Manager",
        "ticketNumber": "TKT-1234567890"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Naming Convention
Files are automatically named using the pattern:
- Format: `{RaffleTitle}_winners_{Timestamp}.csv`
- Example: `Summer_Giveaway_winners_1710543210123.csv`

### Business Rules
- Can only download when at least one winner has been drawn
- Available for active, completed, and closed raffles
- No winners = Error message "No winners found for this raffle draw"

---

## 2. Closed Status Feature

### Description
The "Closed" status is a final state that locks a raffle draw, preventing any further modifications. Once closed, the raffle becomes read-only.

### Status Colors
- **Draft** - Gray (planning stage)
- **Active** - Blue (currently running)
- **Completed** - Green (all prizes drawn)
- **Cancelled** - Red (cancelled)
- **Closed** - Purple üÜï (locked, no edits allowed)

### How to Close a Raffle

#### From Raffle Draw Page
1. Navigate to the raffle draw details page
2. Find the "Mark as Closed" button in the header (purple button with lock icon)
3. Click the button
4. Confirm the action in the dialog
5. The raffle status changes to "Closed"

**Button Availability:**
- Visible when status is "Active" or "Completed"
- Hidden when status is already "Closed"

### What Gets Locked
Once a raffle is marked as "Closed", the following operations are **prevented**:

#### ‚ùå No Edits Allowed
- Cannot update raffle draw details (title, description, date)
- Cannot edit prize information
- Cannot edit participant information

#### ‚ùå No Deletions Allowed
- Cannot delete the raffle draw
- Cannot delete prizes
- Cannot delete participants

#### ‚ùå No Draw Operations Allowed
- Cannot draw new winners
- Cannot reset the draw
- Cannot redraw prizes

#### ‚ùå No Additions Allowed
- Cannot add new prizes
- Cannot add new participants

### What Still Works
Even when closed, you can still:
- ‚úÖ View all information
- ‚úÖ Download winners list
- ‚úÖ Navigate through tabs
- ‚úÖ View draw status

### Use Cases

#### Scenario 1: Final Results Published
1. Complete all prize draws
2. Verify all winners are correct
3. Mark as "Closed" to prevent accidental changes
4. Share the winners list with confidence

#### Scenario 2: Archiving
1. After event is over and winners have received prizes
2. Mark as "Closed" for permanent record
3. Keep for future reference without risk of modification

#### Scenario 3: Audit Trail
1. For compliance or legal requirements
2. Close the raffle to maintain integrity
3. Demonstrate results haven't been tampered with

### Visual Indicators
- **Status Badge**: Purple background with lock icon
- **Disabled Buttons**: Gray/disabled state for all edit buttons
- **Tooltips**: Explain why actions are disabled

## Database Changes

### RaffleDraw Model
Updated the `status` enum to include the new "closed" value:

**Before:**
```javascript
status: {
  type: DataTypes.ENUM('draft', 'active', 'completed', 'cancelled'),
  defaultValue: 'draft',
  allowNull: false
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
status: {
  type: DataTypes.ENUM('draft', 'active', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'closed'),
  defaultValue: 'draft',
  allowNull: false
}
```

### Migration Required
If you have an existing database, you'll need to run a migration to add the 'closed' status to the enum. Contact your database administrator or run:

```sql
ALTER TYPE enum_raffle_draws_status ADD VALUE 'closed';
```
